<h3>HW0: Java Programming</h3>
<p>
In HW0, you are expected to learn:<br>
<li> how to open and read a file?</li>
<li> how to acquire the file name from command arguments (args[])?</li>
<li> how to handle strings in Java?</li>
<li> how to compare strings in Java?</li>
<li> how to allocate a 2D array (matrix)?</li>
<li> how to use for loops for flow control?</li>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Input example:</b><br>
<br>
2,3<br>
Japan,Korea<br>
Finland,Korea,Japan<br>
France,France,Japan<br>
France,Germany,Korea<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
<li> The first row of the file contains two positive integers, where the first number (m=2) indicates the number of strings announced for the Bingo game, and the second number (n=3) indicates the size of your matrix, i.e., n*n. The numbers in the first row are always bigger or equal to 2.</li>
<li> The second row provides the vector of the strings announced for the Bingo game, i.e., Japan,Korea. The elements in the vector are unique.</li>
<li> Finally, the n*n matrix starts from the third row. The elements in the matrix are separated by commas.</li>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Output:</b><br>
<br>
Please report how many straight lines are in the matrix, where a 'straight line' means a row, a column, or a diagonal of the matrix that all the elements in this line are announced for the Bingo game. For the example described above, all the element in the third column (Japan,Japan,Korea) are announced in the Bingo game (Japan,Korea), therefore the third column are described as a 'straight line' <br>
