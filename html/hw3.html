<h3>HW3: Using stacks</h3>

<p><b>Assignment</b><br><br> 
In this homework, you are requested to implement a class named: Calculator<br>
This class must contain a public function with the following API:<br><br>
public Double ans (String e) {<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// please replace the following null to the answer you calculated.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn null<br>
}<br>
</p>

<b>Input to the function 'ans':</b><br>
<br>
( ( ( 1 + ( 12 * 5 ) ) - ( 3 * 4 ) ) + ( 4 / 5 ) )
<br><br>
<b>Return value of the function 'ans':</b><br>
<br>
49.80
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br> 
1. We won't execute your main function in Calculator.java.<br>
2. You do not need to worry about the format of printing the Double value.<br>
3. All the numbers, operators, and brackets are seperated by 'single space', so you don't have to spend much time on parsing string.<br>
4. You only need to handle with the operator such as (+, -, *, /)<br>
<br>
<b>File to be submitted to the judge system:</b><br>
<br>
You are requested to design a Java class named Calculator. So, please submitted a file named: Calculator.java<br>
