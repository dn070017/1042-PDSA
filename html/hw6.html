<H1>HW6 - Back to the Poker Game</H1>
<br>
<b>Assignment</b><br>
<br>
<b>Poker Game:</b>
<p>In the Chinese New Year, cognates play poker game in family parties. Each player is dealt to five cards. Your program is requested to identify which player has the best poker hand.</p>

<p>In this homework, there are three Java classes involved. Please implement some functions in Player.java and Card.java. The Game Class deals five cards to each player (the number of players is given in the first line of the input file), and judges who has the best poker hand.</p>

<p>If multiple players have same priority of hands, compare the high card in it to decide who wins the game. For example, if David has one pair (Spades 10 and Diamonds 10) and Mary has one pair, too (Hearts 10 and Clubs 10), David is the winner, because Spades 10 is higher than Heart 10. (suit priority , Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs).</p>

<p>We only consider six types of hands in the following order (full house > flush > straight > two pair > one pair > high card).<br>

<b>Submission</b><br>
<p>When you are doing the homework, you put all the three class files in the same project. When submitting the homework, you will be requested to upload 'Card.java' and 'Player.java' separately. These files will be judged independently, which means that you are not allowed to modify the interface of the functions.</p>
