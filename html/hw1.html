<h3>HW1: Percolation</h3>
<b>Examples of percolated and not percolated</b><br><br>
<img src = "percolates.png"></img><br>

<p><b>The model.</b> We model a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. 
	Each site is either open or blocked. 
	A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. 
	We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. 
	In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row.

<b>Input:</b><br>
<br>
3<br>
1,1<br>
2,2<br>
3,3<br>
2,1<br>
2,3<br>
3,1<br>
3,2<br>
<br>
Note: The number (N) in the first row specifies size of the system: an N-by-N grid. Each of the remaining rows in the file contains a pair of integers, i.e. the coordinates (row, column), specifying the next site to be opened.
 Please print the first coordinates that results in percolation. If the system did not percolate after handling all the sites in the file, print -1 instead.<br>

<b>Output:</b><br>
<br>
2,3<br>

<b>File to be submitted to the judge system:</b><br>
